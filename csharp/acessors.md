Based on this code:

```csharp
namespace ProjectOne
{
    public class Acessors
    {
        public int MyProperty = 0;
    }
}
```

If this works:

```csharp
Accessors accessors = new() {
    MyProperty = 1
};
Console.WriteLine(accessors.MyProperty); // 1
``````

Why shold i use this:

```csharp
public int MyProperty { get; set; } = 0;
```

In the first case, you have a public field named MyProperty which can be directly accessed and modified from outside the class. However, using public fields for data storage is generally not recommended, especially when you want to maintain control over the access and modification of the data. This is because public fields break encapsulation and make it difficult to introduce logic or validation in the future if needed. You also lose the ability to easily update code in one place (e.g., adding validation or logging) if access to the field is widespread.

In the second example, you're using an auto-implemented property named MyProperty. This property provides a controlled way to access and modify the underlying data. It uses a private field behind the scenes to store the value. This allows you to later add validation, additional logic, or any other behavior in the property's getter or setter without affecting the external code that uses the property. Additionally, you can easily modify the property's behavior without changing the public interface of the class.

In summary, while the two approaches might seem similar when you're just starting to work with simple data, using properties over public fields is a good practice. It provides better encapsulation, control, and the flexibility to evolve your code in the future without breaking existing code that relies on the class's interface.


Get Accessor (get):
The get accessor is used to retrieve the value of a property. When you access the property, the code inside the get accessor is executed, and its return value is used as the property's value.
Example:

```csharp
public class Example
{
    private int _myField;

    public int MyProperty
    {
        get { return _myField; }
    }
}
```

In this example, the MyProperty property exposes the value of the private field _myField. When you access MyProperty, the code within the get accessor is executed, and it returns the value of _myField.

Set Accessor (set):
The set accessor is used to assign a value to a property. When you assign a value to the property, the code inside the set accessor is executed, allowing you to validate or manipulate the incoming value before it's assigned to the property.
Example:

```csharp
public class Example
{
    private int _myField;

    public int MyProperty
    {
        get { return _myField; }
        set { _myField = value; }
    }
}
```

In this example, the MyProperty property has both a get and a set accessor. When you assign a value to MyProperty, the code within the set accessor is executed, allowing you to control how the value is stored in _myField.

Auto-Implemented Properties:
C# also provides a shorthand syntax for creating properties called auto-implemented properties. When you don't need to add any additional logic or validation in the accessors, you can use this simplified syntax:

```csharp
public class Example
{
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, the compiler automatically generates a private backing field and the necessary get and set accessors for you.

Using properties instead of direct public fields allows you to maintain better control over the data, adhere to encapsulation principles, and add or modify behavior in a controlled manner. It also helps you maintain a consistent and clear interface for your classes.
