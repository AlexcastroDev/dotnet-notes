# C# and POO

The paradigms of programming and Object Oriented Programming contents will not be covered here, because I already know them.

# Objects

Here i can see that the objects are instances of classes, and the classes are the blueprints of the objects.

- Properties
- Methods
- Constructors
- Events

# Classes and objects

You can find some examples in `examples` folder.

# Others contents

I will skip notes about the following contents, because I already know them.

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Complex types
- Properties
- Methods
- Using and Dispose
- Static classes
- Interfaces
- Abstract classes
- Generics
- Lists
